# Why? {#why}

EJDB is a C library right? So why a C++ wrapper?

While the C library is indeed usable from C++, its usage is far from idiomatic.
ejpp provides a safe and modern C++ interface, taking advantage of many C++ language and library features such as exceptions, RAII, reference counted dynamic memory, containers, and more.
